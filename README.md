This repo contains two versions of a command-line
based calculator application.

`simpleCalculator.js` asks for a sinlge operation
followed by two numbers and outputs the result
of applying the operation to those numbers.

`bonusCalculator.js` allows multiple operations
to be entered on a single line and outputs the
result. Note that the order of operations is
linear and does not follow PEMDAS.
